    > ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

    Augmented:
    The error occurs in `LogisticRegressionCV` when `print_changed_only=True` and `Cs` is a numpy array, raising a ValueError about ambiguous array truth value during parameter comparison. The issue likely stems from a boolean check in the repr logic comparing `Cs` (array) to its default value (`np.logspace(-4, 4, 8)`), where element-wise equality produces an array of booleans instead of a scalar. The problematic code likely resides in `__init__` or parameter validation logic using `if Cs != default`, requiring `.all()` or `.any()` for array comparisons. The error is triggered during `print()` due to `set_config(print_changed_only=True)` modifying the repr behavior.

    When training a model using `transformers.Trainer` with `fp16=True` on a 4GB GPU, training silently hangs. No traceback or error message is shown; the training loop remains stuck after the first step.

    Augmented:
    `transformers.Trainer` hangs during training when `fp16=True` and VRAM is low (e.g., 4GB GPU). Likely module involved: `accelerate` or mixed precision handling in `Trainer`. Expected OOM error or graceful fallback, but instead the training loop freezes without exception, possibly due to unhandled CUDA error or silent failure in gradient scaler."""
